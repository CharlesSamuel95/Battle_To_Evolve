Battle_To_Evolve is a JavaFX game that allowes users to create and customize their new characters states and fight against CPUsâ€™ random generated characters. In the character creater, users can give their character a portrait. This portrait can be a jpg, png, or gif file. If one is not provided, then one will be assigned. Characters will be stored inside xml files, and users can store this file anywhere on their machine. The battle speed can also be modified before the battle.


Details about how to play the game are found in the start menu (or by viewing text files located here:
Team-6-Fall-20\Battle_To_Evolve\resources\rules_text_files).

Our team used the MVC design pattern, so to start the program execute MainApp.java file locate  here (Team-6-Fall-20\Battle_To_Evolve\src\evolve).


Inside the Team-6-Fall-20 folder, there is a UML diagram for this JavaFX game. 
MainAppTest.java (stored here: Team-6-Fall-20\Battle_To_Evolve\src\unitTesting) contains our junit tests.
