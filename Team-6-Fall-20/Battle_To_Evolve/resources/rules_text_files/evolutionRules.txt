At the end of a battle the winner will get to choose a character from both their team and the enemy team to evolve together.

The chances of evolution is random but it is guaranteed that the winners statistics will be the minimum of the evolved characters statistics.

However, the winning character does have a chance of a percentage of the losing characters statistics.
These percentages are completely random and only apply to characteristics that are higher on the loser than the winner.
