A battle will continue until all characters of one team die or if a team surrenders.

While there is no time limit on battle there is a battle clock to keep track of the time of the battle.

During a battle characters do have a chance at getting a critical hit:
There are three types of critical hits:
1.25% : Where the character does 1.25% damage of it attack statistic
1.50% : Where the character does 1.50% damage of it attack statistic
2.00% : Where the character does 2x damage of it attack statistic
The chance of this occurrence is based on the characters luck 

A character can also dodge an attack, when a character dodges an attack it receives no damage.
This chance is also based on a characters luck, the luckier the character the higher dodge chance.
